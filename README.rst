virtinit
========

virtinit is short for Virtualization Initialization. It is a script to help
bootstrap a personal machine for doing development with virtual machines.
This involves doing some hardware checks and installing a specific set of
software. The approach taken is quite precriptive and has grown out of a set
of personal preferences found to be useful but it may also proove useful to
you.

The script is currently targeted at Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.
